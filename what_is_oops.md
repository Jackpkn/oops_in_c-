**OOPS:**
- Object Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer program rather than using only functions and procedures.
- It focuses on using classes to define objects and their behaviors.
- It is based on the concept of "objects" which can contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of procedures.
**Features of OOPS:**
1. **Encapsulation:** It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit called a class.
2. **Inheritance:** It is the mechanism by which one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class. It provides reusability of code.
3. **Polymorphism:** It is the ability to present the same interface for different data types. It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.  Enabling objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, often through method overriding or overloading.
4. **Abstraction:** It is the concept of object-oriented programming that “shows” only essential attributes and “hides”(complex implementation) unnecessary information. It reduces programming complexity and effort.
