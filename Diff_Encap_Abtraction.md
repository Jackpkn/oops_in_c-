The key difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation lies in their purpose and how they are implemented in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

### 1. Purpose:
**Abstraction:**
- Focuses on hiding complexity and exposing only the essential features of an object or system.
- It’s about what an object does (i.e., the behavior and functionality), rather than how it does it.
- Helps in simplifying the interaction with the object by hiding the unnecessary details.

**Encapsulation:**
- Focuses on bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class.
- It also involves restricting access to some of the object’s components by using access modifiers (like private, public, protected).
- Helps in protecting the object’s internal state and ensuring that only valid modifications are made.

### 2. Implementation:
**Abstraction:**
- Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces. In C++, it’s done by declaring pure virtual functions (functions with = 0).
- Abstracts away the complexity of the underlying code and exposes only what is necessary for the user.

**Encapsulation:**
- Achieved using access modifiers (private, protected, public) to hide the internal state of an object.
- Internal data is usually made private or protected, and external access is provided through getter and setter methods (public functions).

### 3. Example:
**Abstraction Example:**
A class `Shape` might have an abstract method `draw()` that every derived class (like `Circle` and `Square`) implements differently. The user doesn’t need to know the exact details of how each shape is drawn, just that it can be drawn.

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // Abstract method
};
```

**Encapsulation Example:**
A class `Account` encapsulates the balance (data) and provides methods like `deposit()` and `getBalance()` (behaviors) to access and modify it.

```cpp
class Account {
private:
    double balance;  // Encapsulated data

public:
    void deposit(double amount) {
        if(amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }

    double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
};
```

### 4. Focus:
- **Abstraction** is about hiding implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionality.
- **Encapsulation** is about hiding the internal state and providing controlled access to it through public methods.

### Summary:
| Feature   | Abstraction | Encapsulation |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Purpose   | Hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features | Hides internal data and provides controlled access |
| Focus     | What an object does (behavior) | How data is stored and accessed |
| Achieved By | Abstract classes, interfaces, pure virtual functions | Access modifiers (private, public), getter/setter methods |
| Example   | `Shape` class with a `draw()` method (abstract behavior) | `Account` class with balance data and methods like `deposit()` |

Both concepts work together to improve software design by making it more modular, maintainable, and flexible.
